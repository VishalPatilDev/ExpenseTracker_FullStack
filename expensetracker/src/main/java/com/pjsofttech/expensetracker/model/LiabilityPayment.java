/**
 * A single real-world payment made against a Liability (e.g. one EMI).
 *
 * Splits into:
 *   - principalComponent: reduces Liability.outstandingAmount, no Expense impact
 *   - interestComponent : creates/links a real Expense, no Liability impact
 *
 * totalAmount = principalComponent + interestComponent, and is exactly what
 * gets debited from the bank, once, per payment.
 *
 * This intentionally does NOT reuse ExpenseInstallmentPayment — a liability
 * payment has two components with different downstream effects, whereas an
 * expense installment payment has exactly one.
